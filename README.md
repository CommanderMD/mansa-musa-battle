# Black Excellence: Multiplier Battle
### Chapter 1 — The Golden Age of Mali · Anchor: Mansa Musa

A mobile-portrait **2.5D "archery march" lane auto-battler** in the spirit of crowd-army
clash games. Steer a marching column of Mali archers up a receding lane; they auto-loose
**arrow volleys** at **destructible reward barrels** rolling toward you — shoot a barrel's
HP to zero before it reaches the column to grow your army (greedy high-HP kegs vs safe ones
is the core choice). Smash through raider waves, grab gold and crystals, and beat the boss
formation at the lane's end. Win a level and you unlock a historically accurate
**dossier** on Mansa Musa, with a "Read more" link to the live
[Black Achievement Digital Museum](https://black-achievement-museum.ericarmstrong.workers.dev).

Built as a **self-contained static site** (Phaser 3 from CDN, all art generated procedurally
at runtime — zero binary assets), so it deploys cleanly on Cloudflare Workers static assets.

> The 2.5D look = flat placeholder art + perspective scaling + a painted receding lane.
> Not top-down, not real 3D.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Drag** (touch or mouse, anywhere) | Steer the whole crowd left/right |
| (automatic) | The crowd auto-fires arrow volleys at the **nearest** barrel — steer to choose which one |
| **PLAY / CONTINUE / RETRY** buttons | Navigate menus |

**v3 — aim by alignment:** arrows now fire **straight up** from the crowd (no auto-homing).
A barrel is only hit if your arrows actually **overlap its x-position** as they pass — so you
must steer the crowd to **line up under** the keg you want. Misaligned arrows visibly sail past
and off the top. A wider/bigger army sprays more arrows (and helps), but **alignment is the skill**.

The column auto-advances and auto-shoots; you control **which barrel your archers focus** (by
lining up under it).
Each barrel shows two numbers: a **hit-count (HP)** that ticks down as arrows bite, and a
**reward**. There are **two barrel types**:

- **CROWD kegs** (gold/green) — grow the army: `x3`, `x2`, `+25` **units**.
- **WEAPON kegs** (blue, 🏹) — multiply **arrows-per-unit**: `🏹x2` bows, `🏹+1` arrow.
  Every archer starts at **1 arrow/shot**; weapon kegs raise it (1 → 2 → 4 …).

**Total firepower = units × arrows-per-unit**, so the two paths combine. More units also means
more bodies to survive enemy clashes; more arrows-per-unit means each archer hits harder — a
real strategic choice each run. Bigger firepower breaks high-HP kegs in time. Break the safe
low-HP keg for sure, or gamble on a greedy high-HP keg — but a barrel that reaches the column
**alive smashes in and costs units**, so overcommitting to a keg you can't break is how you lose.

### The loop
1. **World map** — pick an unlocked node, press the gold **PLAY** button.
2. **Battle** — shoot down reward barrels — gold **crowd kegs** (`x3 +25` units) and blue
   **weapon kegs** (`🏹x2` arrows/unit) — grab gold chests + crystals, and clash with enemy
   waves (top-center counter = enemy strength).
3. **Boss** — a large formation at the end needs a threshold-size crowd.
4. **Victory** — winged banner, reward tiles, and a Mansa Musa dossier card. The next level
   unlocks. **Defeat** — retry.

Progress (gold, crystals, unlocked levels) is saved to `localStorage`.

## Run locally

It's a static site — any static server works:

```bash
# option A: wrangler (matches production)
npx wrangler dev

# option B: any static server
npx serve public
# or
python3 -m http.server -d public 8000
```

Then open the printed URL. (Opening `index.html` via `file://` will not work because it
uses ES modules — serve it over HTTP.)

---

## Deploy (Cloudflare Workers static assets)

This repo is wired for the TechSmart pipeline (Workers static assets + GitHub auto-deploy).

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

…or **double-click `DEPLOY.command`** (it runs `wrangler login` then `wrangler deploy`).
Live URL: `https://mansa-musa-battle.<account-subdomain>.workers.dev`.

For GitHub auto-deploy, connect the repo in the Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages →
Create → Import a repository → keep the deploy command `npx wrangler deploy`. Set the
Cloudflare project name to **`mansa-musa-battle`** (match the worker name).

```

**Design intent:** `config.js` + `data/chapters.js` hold everything content/balance; the
scenes and entities are the reusable engine. Art lives in `systems/textures.js`. Game feel
lives in `systems/juice.js`.

---

## Adding the other four eras (and a Flutter/Unity port)

The engine is data-driven so the remaining chapters slot in with no scene changes:

1. **Add a chapter** in `src/data/chapters.js` following the `CHAPTER1` shape:
   - `levels[]` each with a `track` (a distance-ordered list of `barrels` / `enemy` /
     `pickup` events), a `boss`, `startCrowd`, and `length`. A `barrels` event holds 1–2
     kegs `{ side, hp, reward }`; pairs create the greedy-vs-safe choice.
   - a `DOSSIER`-style object with **accurate, sourced** facts for that era's anchor figure.
2. **Reskin the palette** in `config.js` (`PALETTE`) and the art in `systems/textures.js`
   (e.g. different robes, terrain props). The lane geometry and feel carry over.
3. **Register** the chapter and add its nodes to `MapScene` (or generalize the map to read a
   `CHAPTERS` array — left as the natural next refactor).

Because gameplay, content, and art are cleanly separated, a **Flutter (Flame)** or **Unity**
port can mirror the same module boundaries: a `Lane` renderer, a `Crowd` actor, gate/enemy/
pickup entities, and a data layer that reads the same chapter/track JSON. Keep `chapters.js`
as the canonical content source and export it to JSON for the native ports.

## Content & rights

- All art is **original / procedurally generated** placeholder art. No third-party game art,
  logos, names, or UI are used — visual-style references only.
- Historical content about Mansa Musa and the Mali Empire is kept **accurate and respectful**
  (reign c. 1312–1337, the 1324 pilgrimage to Mecca, Timbuktu/Sankore as a center of learning,
  his legendary wealth). Deeper reading links to the live Black Achievement Digital Museum.
